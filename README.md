## Option 1: Robo Advisor for Retirement Plans

### Background

In this homework assignment, I created a chatbot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.

I did this by:

1. **Initial Robo Advisor Configuration:** Defined an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about the requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

2. **Built and Tested the Robo Advisor** I tested each slot and made sure they were being saved correctly.

3. **Enhanced the Robo Advisor with an Amazon Lambda Function** Created an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation.
